Implementation of Grep commands[Global Regulation Expression Print]

Aim: To search a file for a prticular string. 

	grep -r :  traverse through directories and grep

MATCHING CONTROL:

	grep -i :  ignore case distinctions

	grep -v :   select non-matching lines

	grep -w :  Select only those  lines  containing  matches  that  form  whole
           words.


GENERAL OUTPUT:
	grep -c :  print only a count of matching lines per FILE

*	grep -m :  Stop  reading  a file after NUM(i.e. max_count) matching lines. 

	grep -q :   Do not write  anything  to  standard  output. (QUIETE)


OUTPUT LINE PREFIX CONTROL:

	grep -b :   Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before  each
                    line of output.

	grep -H :    print the file name for each match

	grep -h : Output matching lines without preceding them by file names
	
					*REFERENCE TO VARIOUS FUNCTIONS**
		
					
* The Program uses get_token and mystrstr functions to find the pattern and print the lines containing the pattern.

* get_token divides the file content into single lines and seearches for the pattern.

* mystrstr searches for the pattern and then prints the line if the pattern is found.

* Various options implemented are shown in ./mygrep -h. 

* -r option which traverses through directories.
  It is implemented in dir.c. dirent.h is used to do so.
  mystrstrcase function ignores case to search pattern.
