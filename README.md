Implementation of Grep commands[Global Regulation Expression Print]

Aim: To search a file for a particular string. 

**REFERENCE TO VARIOUS FUNCTIONS**
		
					
* The Program uses get_token and mystrstr functions to find the pattern and print the lines containing the pattern.

* get_token divides the file content into single lines and searches for the pattern.

* Various options implemented are shown in ./mygrep -h. 

* -r option which traverses through directories.
  It is implemented in dir.c. dirent.h is used to do so.
  mystrstrcase function ignores case to search pattern.
